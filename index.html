        The Jantar Mantar is an equinoctial sundial, consisting of a gigantic triangular gnomon with the hypotenuse parallel to the Earth's axis. On either side of the gnomon is a quadrant of a circle, parallel to the plane of the equator. The instrument is intended to measure the time of day, correct to half a second and declination of the Sun and the other heavenly bodies.

There were five Jantar Mantars in India, of which the largest is in Jaipur which features many instruments along with the world's largest stone sundial.[1] At present only four Jantar Mantar exist, as the Jantar Mantar at Mathura was torn down just before Revolt of 1857. The Vrihat Samrat Yantra is a sundial that is claimed to give the local time to an accuracy of 2 seconds.[2] It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

             <p> Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse the damage caused by Thanos in Infinity War.

The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise, as well as music from previous films. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, New York state, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.

Avengers: Endgame premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.798 billion worldwide, surpassing Infinity War's entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, which it held from July 2019 until March 2021. The film received numerous awards and nominations, including a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, three nominations at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards (winning two), and a nomination for Special Visual Effects at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards.  </p>

            <p>The Lion King is a 2019 American musical drama film directed and produced by Jon Favreau, written by Jeff Nathanson, and produced by Walt Disney Pictures. It is a photorealistic computer-animated remake of Disney's traditionally animated 1994 film of the same name. The film stars the voices of Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alfre Woodard, Billy Eichner, John Kani, John Oliver, Florence Kasumba, Eric Andre, Keegan-Michael Key, JD McCrary, Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, as well as James Earl Jones reprising his role from the original film. The plot follows Simba, a young lion who must embrace his role as the rightful king of his native land following the murder of his father, Mufasa, at the hands of his uncle, Scar.

Plans for a remake of 1994's The Lion King were confirmed in September 2016 following box office successes for Disney remakes such as The Jungle Book (2016), which was also directed by Favreau. Favreau was inspired by certain roles of characters in the Broadway adaptation, and developed upon elements of the original film's story. Much of the main cast signed in early 2017, and principal photography began in mid-2017 on a blue screen stage in Los Angeles. The "virtual-reality tools" utilized in The Jungle Book's cinematography were used to a greater degree during filming of The Lion King. Composers Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and lyricist Tim Rice, all of whom worked on the original's soundtrack, returned to compose the score alongside Knowles-Carter, who assisted John in the reworking of the soundtrack and wrote a new song for the film, titled "Spirit", which she also performed. The film serves as the final credit for editor Mark Livolsi, and it is dedicated to his memory. With an estimated budget of around $260 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made. </p>

        Coronavirus Cases and Deaths in India Today, Covid-19 Vaccine Live Tracker: The number of active Covid-19 cases in India has dipped further and experts believe that it is now in the zone where the existing health infrastructure can handle it. According to the Union Health Ministry, the daily positivity rate has now dropped to 6.21 per cent. The number of active cases has begun to fall in almost all the states and the biggest relief is that a dip is clearly visible in the daily count of deaths.

Meanwhile, over 22.37 lakh doses of vaccine have been administered in the country. The health ministry said that out of total people vaccine vaccinated so far, 99,24,634 are healthcare and 1,59,18,192 frontline workers who have taken the first dose.

         India on Friday finally formally cleared the decks for the long-pending Rs 50,000 crore project to domestically construct six new-generation stealth submarines with foreign collaboration, in what is called the `mother of all underwater combat deals’.
The Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council (DAC) approved the tender or RFP (request for proposal) to be issued to defence shipyard Mazagon Docks (MDL) and private ship-builder L&T. The two were shortlisted for the diesel-electric submarine-building programme called `Project-75 India (P-75I)’ after a long-drawn process.
P-75I will be the first project to be launched under the strategic partnership (SP) policy, which was promulgated by the NDA government in May 2017 under the overall “Make in India” platform.
After RFP is issued, the two Indian `strategic partners’, MDL and L&T, will tie-up with one of the five selected foreign shipyards to submit their technical and financial bids.
